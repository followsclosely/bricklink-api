/**
 * Provides classes for loading and processing BrickLink catalog data files.
 * <p>
 * This package contains catalog loader implementations for various BrickLink catalog resources, such as categories, colors, and items.
 * Each loader is responsible for reading a specific catalog file and mapping its contents to domain objects for further processing or integration.
 * <p>
 * Typical usage involves instantiating a loader class and invoking its methods to parse and retrieve catalog data as DTOs.
